# Ground
Data and information store created as part of discovery stimulus for open data and analytics in ground engineering, contaminated land and hydrogeology.

## Land Contamination Data Inventory
Data inventory for data used within land contamination risk assessment as per the [Land Contamination: Risk Management](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/land-contamination-how-to-manage-the-risks) guidance.
The data inventory was completed using professional knowledge from experts who regularly complete risk assessments. It is hoped that over time, this data inventory can grow due to open access.
The community can contribute new data sources, update existing information and/or submit issues to this repository.  
### Risk Assessment Process
The assessment of land contamination is typically completed in three stages:
* Tier 1: Preliminary Risk Assessment (PRA) typically involves a desk based review of information and a site walkover;
* Tier 2: Generic Quantitative Risk Assessment (GQRA) typically involves site investigation, monitoring and comparison of measured concentrations of chemicals within soil, soil-derived leachate
and groundwater to generic assessment criteria;
* Tier 3: Detailed Quantitative Risk Assessment (DQRA)  which involves modelling of fate and transport of contaminants to receptors.
Sources, pathways and receptors are presented in a conceptual model for a site at the end of each stage of the risk assessment. If a risk is considered to be unacceptable, a further stage of the
assessment is undertaken, potentially leading to an options appraisal and remediation of the site.
### Importance Ranking
Professional judgement was used to initially prioritise the importance of each dataset. It is hoped, that more formal prioritisation could be developed over time.
Statistical analysis could be used to better understand relationships and provide the basis for prioritisation of the data. At present, only two categories of importance ranking are available:
* 1 - very important
* 2 - important

### Limitations
* Flood risk data are excluded.
* Review of available datasets focused on England only. Availability of datasets for Wales and Scotland are listed in case this was obvious.
